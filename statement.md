## Project Title: 
**Caesar Cipher Text Encryption Tool**

## Problem Statement:
In everyday digital communication, sensitive text messages can be intercepted and misused if transmitted without protection. Many users need a simple and user-friendly method to secure their messages without requiring advanced technical knowledge or modern cryptographic systems.  
The Caesar Cipher Text Encryption Tool provides an easy way to encrypt and decrypt text messages using shift-based substitution, making text unintelligible to unintended readers.

## Scope of the Project:
This project allows users to ->
- Encrypt and decrypt text using a customizable shift value.
- Choose between encoding and decoding modes.
- Safely process messages containing letters, numbers and symbols.

## Target Users: 
- Students learning Python programming.
- Beginners in cybersecurity and cryptography.
- Users who want to protect personal text messages.
- Educators teaching classical encryption techniques.

## High-Level Features:
- Text Encryption           => Converts plain text into cipher text using shift values.
-Text Decryption            => Restores encoded text back to original form.
-Input Validation           => Ensures correct user input and prevents errors.
-Special Character Handling => Preserves non-alphabet characters unchanged.
-User friendly              => Simple, interactive and easy to use.
