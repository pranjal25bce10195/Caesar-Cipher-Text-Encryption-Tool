# Caesar-Cipher-Text-Encryption-Tool
# Overview : 
The **Caesar Cipher Text Encryption Tool** is a Python-based application that encrypts and decrypts text using the classical Caesar cipher technique. It allows users to enter a message and shift value, and then choose whether to encode or decode the message. This project demonstrates basic cryptographic concepts and string manipulation in Python.
# Features:
- Encrypt and decrypt text using a shift value
- Handles alphabetical and non-alphabetical characters
- Supports large shift values (with modulo handling)
- Preserves spaces, numbers, and punctuation
# Technologies used:
Pycharm - code editor used to write and run the python code
Github - hosting platform for sharing the project
